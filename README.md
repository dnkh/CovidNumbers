# CovidNumbers

To have a clear, readable and  mobile friendly overview of the current COVID-19 numbers of the county **Rhein-Neckar-Kreis**, I worte a small progressiv web app (PWA), because in my opinion, that's not the case for the official website. 
Offical website

* [COVID-19-Dashboard - Desktop-Version](https://lrarnk.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/7779ff038a134df7a30db2f638fff6ca)
* [COVID-19-Dashboard - Mobile Version](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/8350896011f046c88cf019fc8542b175)

Because this webapp uses the same API as the official website it also uses the same numbers
